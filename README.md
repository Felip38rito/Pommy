# Pommy
Simple pomodoro solution implemented in python

## Usage:
You can run pommy locally by using (only python >= 3 is supported) 
```bash
python3 pommy.py 
# python3 pommy.py -h for help with the parameters
```
I recomend you create an alias for the command line. 

You can do it by editing ~/.bash_profile file adding:

```bash
alias pommy="/..your_python3_dir../python ~/yourdirectory/.../pommy.py"
```
And then, you can run only the pommy command from inside any directory of your os. 

For now, you can stop pommy using Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z
